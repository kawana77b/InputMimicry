# Install

Packages are distributed through **Github Packages**. Check the `packages` page for details.  
**Personal Access Token configuration is required to install the package**. Please check the following page:  
[Working with the NuGet registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-nuget-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token)

Use `dotnet nuget add source` or add feeds with `Nuget.Config`.  
Please add `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/kawana77b/index.json` to the package source and set your personal token.

Or clone the repository and include the project.

Currently I am not willing to host this project in NuGet.
